# Responsive Portfolio

## Motivation
I really wanted to start working on my portfolio as I start learning how to code so that I can constantly go back and make it look better as I aquire more knowledge

## What will this do for me?
This will allow employers and recruiters to access my projects. They can use their mobile devices if they have packed schedules and are checking possible recruits while moving though their day to day. 

## What problem does this solve
* Having your pages be responsive means the content can be viewed on devices as small as a cell phone and as large as a full size monitor.
* Having mobile responsive pages makes your site up to date with the times. People use their phones and tablets to do the majority of their browsing now days.
* Having a properly structured site that flows nicely and doesnt frustrate the user can help generate more visits to the site, which leads to more revenue.

## What I learned
* I learned how to utilize bootstraps components to save myself time while building an aesthetic page
* I learned how much time can be saved utilizing bootstraps html template and container classes to make my pages mobile responsive.
* I learned how to implement columns and rows properly so I can build something from scratch.
